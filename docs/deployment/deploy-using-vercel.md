# Deploy Frontity using Vercel

In [their own words](https://vercel.com/docs) : _Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and **Serverless Functions** that fits perfectly with your workflow. It enables developers to host Jamstack sites and web services that **deploy instantly**, **scale automatically**, and **requires no supervision**, all with **no configuration**._

We strongly recommend this service as it is serverless, cheap, [includes CDN](../performance/caching.md#cdn-for-frontity-servers), and really easy to set up.

It also supports the cache technique stale-while-revalidate \(they name it [Serverless Pre-Rendering](https://vercel.com/blog/serverless-pre-rendering)\), a powerful way to improve your site speed.

To be able to deploy with `vercel` you need to have a Vercel account. You can [signup here](https://vercel.com/signup).

Once you have an account you have to [login](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/login) to Vercel from the terminal

```text
> npx vercel login
```

These are the instructions to deploy a Frontity project on Vercel, once you are ready to deploy your project:

### Create a [`vercel.json`](https://vercel.com/docs/configuration#introduction/configuration-reference)

1. Create this `vercel.json` file and save it in the root your Frontity project

```text
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@frontity/now"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deploy

Deploy Frontity using the [`vercel` command](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#getting-started) \(from the root of your project\):

```text
> npx vercel
```

You should get something like this

```text
Vercel CLI 19.2.0
? Set up and deploy “~/PROJECTS/2020/FRONTITY/DEMOS/my-frontity-project”? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? myVercelScope
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? What’s your project’s name? my-frontity-project
? In which directory is your code located? ./
🔗  Linked to vercel-username/head-tags (created .vercel)

```

Vercel will assign you a domain \(something like _your-project-name.vercel.app_\) that that will allow you to check your site online

From this deploy example we have got the following URL's:

* **Live URL:** `https://my-frontity-project.vercel.app` → Our temporary URL assigned automatically by Vercel, We can check \(and share\) our site online from this URL
* **Inspect:** `https://vercel.com/vercel-username/my-frontity-project/settings` → Here we can check the status of our site and check the logs among other things
* **Project Settings:** `https://vercel.com/vercel-username/my-frontity-project/settings` → Here we can change domain and build settings among other things

## Deploy your site under a custom domain

To deploy your site under a custom domain you have to

* Configure your Frontity app to point to that custom domain
* Configure your custom domain for your project in the Vercel settings
* Add Vercel nameservers for your custom domain from your domain provider

...before deploying it

### Add your custom domain in your project settings

From the project settings URL provided in our previous deploy \(`https://vercel.com/vercel-username/my-frontity-project/settings` in our example\) we can set a custom domain

![](https://frontity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04//now-projects-settings.png)

Add it, and you will be provided by a [set a nameservers](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/custom-domains#step-4:-configuring-the-domain) you can use in your domain provider to point your custom domain to the Vercel nameservers

![vercel nameservers](https://frontity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04//vercel-nameservers.png)

### Add subdomain in your project settings

A subdomain can be used to separate your WordPress and Frontity deployments. They can be created within Vercel dashboard from the [domains section](https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains/).

To setup a subdomain for your WordPress source, simply select your desired domain from the [list](https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains/) and [add a new DNS Record](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/custom-domains#step-2:-add-dns-record) with type A and the IP address of your WordPress server.

### Add Vercel nameservers in your domain provider

You need to set [Vercel nameservers](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/custom-domains/#option-2:-using-external-nameservers) as custom DNS of your custom domain from your domain provider site

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't know how to do this, contact your domain provider \(GoDaddy, CloudFlare, etc\)
{% endhint %}

### Deploy

Then, deploy Frontity using this command \(from the root of your project\):

```text
> npx vercel --prod
```

You should get something like this

```text
⬢  my-frontity-project  npx vercel --prod

🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/vercel-username/my-frontity-project/9ue4zsq9n [2s]
✅  Production: https://mycustomtomain.com [copied to clipboard] [4s]
```

This will create a deploy and assign it to your real site URL.

### Vercel and HTTPS

Vercel now forces all apps to be served over HTTPS. You therefore need to ensure that your WordPress site has a SSL certificate and that you connect to your WordPress API endpoint using HTTPS rather than HTTP.

```text
{
      "name": "@frontity/wp-source",
      "state": {
        "source": {
          "url": "https://your-wordpress-blog-url/",
        }
      }
    },
...
```

The effect of using a HTTP only connection on a Frontity project deployed on Vercel will result in navigation links not working and getting stuck in the `data.isFetching` state \(although apparently working on the local dev machine\). The reason is that Frontity won't be able to fetch the content from the WordPress backend over HTTP on a pure HTTPS site.
